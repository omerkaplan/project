Slug: about



I'm **Omer Kaplan**, a long time product manager and learner, dedicating my time and talent to creating positive impact through empathy and mindful use of technology. Currently, I'm the head of product at [Sonara Health](http://sonarahealth.com), a startup company on a mission to equitably increasing access to life saving medication. Previously, I had the honor of spending time at [Dayton Children's Hospital](https://www.childrensdayton.org/) as the consumer digital engagement officer.

Over the past few years, I'm focused improving the lives of vulnerable, sometime stigmatized populations in the Healthcare technology space. If you share a similar mindset and want to reach out, I encourage you to do so by clicking on the link below.

## about /project 

I spent the majority of my day writing stories, whether it's product related documents, roadmaps, technical stuff, investor decks, [synthesizing context](https://slashproject.co/posts/2020/what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-master-of-product/) and re-packaging it. This website combines my passion for writing and coding, my own corner in the world wide web.

Coding-wise, I enjoy jumping into new technologies and use them to solve my mundane issues: After being bothered with the fact that there are no syndication in esports news, I built esports Radar, [that got too big for its own good](https://slashproject.co/posts/2020/ive-decided-to-shut-down-my-300k-mau-side-project-heres-what-i-learned/), couldn't find people my age to play Animal Crossing with - built the [Animal Crossing pen-pan club](https://slashproject.co/posts/2020/project-story-the-animal-crossing-pen-pal-club/), drank from the Twitter data firehose analyzing data related to depression, programmed a [rogue-like text based adventure game](https://github.com/omerkaplan/lair-of-xorath), somehow I'm always building something.
